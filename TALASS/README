Topological Analysis Proxy-apps 
-------------------------------
Version 1.0

This is a collection of proxy-apps for insitu topological analysis

In this version, we provide an app named "localCompute" which is supported by
utilities named "createDataBlock" and "generateData"
We also provide an app named "joinTrees" that emulates the computation performed
by a core or process during the "join" phases of the merge tree computation.

We now provide a detailed description of each of the proxy-app

(A) localCompute:
----------------

This app performs the local computation phase of the in-situ parallel merge tree
computation. This local compute phase computes the merge tree for the data block
assigned to the process. So the app takes as input a raw block of floats and
computes the merge tree for that block and exits. 

Usage: localCompute <input_file> <block_dim_x> <block_dim_y> <block_dim_z> [min
threshold] [max_threshold]

parameters:
<input_file> - file containing the data block
<block_dim_x> <block_dim_y> <block_dim_z> - data dimensions of the input block
[min threshold] [max_threshold] - the threshold values for the data (these are
optional parameters)

A sample data file has been provided under the ParallelTopology/data folder
named sample_data_hcci_28_28_28.raw which has dimensions of 28x28x28. This
sample block of data has been extracted from the S3D - HCCI simulation rr_OH field
data set. The block dimension of 28x28x28 matches the data decomposition of HCCI
when run on 21952 cores. 

Using the above sample data set, the command line for the proxy app would be as
follows:
localCompute ../../data/sample_data_hcci_28_28_28.raw 28 28 28 0.01

where 0.01 is a suitable min_threshold value for this data set.

(B) joinTrees:
-------------

This app emulates the computation performed by a core or process during the 
"join" phases of the merge tree computation. The merge tree computation has a
local compute phase followed by join phase which performs a hierarchical k-way
merge to compute the merge tree. 

We have provided a database of the MPI messages that were generated when
computing a merge tree of a chunk of an S3D - HCCI(rr_OH field) data set on 8 cores. With
the help of these stored messages the app can emulate the behavior of any of the
8 processes that were originally used to compute the merge tree. The desired
process id can be provided as a command line argument to the app.

Usage: joinTrees <process_id> <numProcX> <numProcY> <numProcZ> <MergeFactor>

parameters:
<process_id> - the desired process rank of which the join  behavior is to be emulated
<<numProcX> <numProcY> <numProcZ> - the process decomposition of the original
experiment. We emulate the behavior of the <process_id> rank of the experiment
using this app.
<MergeFactor> - the merge factor "k" that was used in the k-way merge.

Other Utilities:
---------------

1. generateData: This utility generates a block of floats of given dimensions
using random float values.

2. createDataBlock: This utility extracts a block of data from a large data set.
One has to provide the data set file, the dimensions of the original data set,
dimensions of the required new block and the offset from which the data block
needs to extracted.


How to build the app
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install Prerequisites: cmake, MPI 

cd ParallelTopology
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make <app name> 

The binaries would be built under the utilities folder in the build directory

NOTE: this app is a single process app and does not use MPI. Although, MPI is
required to build the parallelMT library being used by this app. So, a valid MPI
path is required during the build process.

Running the apps
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) For localCompute:

cd utilities
localCompute ../../data/sample_data_hcci_28_28_28.raw 28 28 28 0.01

2) For joinTrees:

cd utilities
joinTrees 0 2 2 2 2
